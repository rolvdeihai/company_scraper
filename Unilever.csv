They have been in business for over 150 years and are one of the largest companies in the world. They are known for their commitment to sustainability and ethical practices, which has earned them several awards and recognition from various organizations.In a company-wide meeting at Unilever Indonesia, four different departments – Marketing (M), Research & Development (R&D), Product (P), and Legal (L) – each have a new project that they are working on related to ESG (Environmental Sustainability, Social Responsibility, Governance). The projects are: a recycling program for plastic bottles, the development of an ethical supply chain, the creation of more sustainable packaging, and the implementation of transparency reporting. Each department is working on a different project. From the conversation below, determine which department is working on which project:1) The Legal Department isn’t working on the sustainability in their Supply Chain or transparency reporting.2) The R&D Department's project has something to do with creating more sustainable packaging but it's not their own project.3) The Marketing Department's project is directly related to plastic bottles, and it's not the recycling program.4) The project of the Product department focuses on governance. 5) Transparency reporting isn’t associated with the Legal or R&D departments.6) Social responsibility is the focus of one of the projects, but it's not at R&D Department.Question: Which department is working on which project?From clue 4, we know that the Product department is focused on governance. Hence, the other three projects are related to the two remaining departments (Legal and Marketing). The Legal department isn’t working on the sustainability in their Supply Chain or transparency reporting, so they must be creating more sustainable packaging since it's left as a possibility for them. This means that Transparency Reporting is handled by either the Marketing or R&D Department. But from clue 5, Transparency Reporting can't be with R&D (they are focused on creating sustainable packaging), so it has to be the Marketing department’s project.From step 2, it's clear that the only left project for R&D is the sustainability in their Supply Chain since it's the only one left and it fits with clue 6 - Social Responsibility which is handled by Marketing Department. Answer: The Legal department is working on creating more sustainable packaging, the Research & Development is responsible for the sustainability in their Supply Chains, the Product department focuses on Governance, and the Marketing department implements Transparency Reporting.","['unvr.indonesia@unilever.com.Get', 'unvr.indonesia@unilever.com', 'Investor.Relations-Indonesia@unilever.com.Get', 'UFS.Indonesia@unilever.com', 'UFS.Indonesia@unilever.com', 'cec.philippines@unilever.com']"," Unilever is a consumer goods company that produces and sells various products, such as food, beverages, home care, personal care, and other household products.
